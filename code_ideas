from what i am understanding, i will need to do a thread to each philosopher, inside the
threads functions, all of them are going to receive the parameters needed by the the function
to access the information of the philosopher(like time_to_die, to eat and sleep), and access
to the forks in the table(or could be to the forks that are going to next to him);

Info needed by the philosopher:
	-Time now;
	-Time last eaten/time beggining;
	-Time before death;
	-Time to sleep;
	-Many eaten;
	-Fork;

The struct where my philosofer is, is being called by another structure(t_all), where I have
all my data

the philosopher, when he is not sleeping he is thinking, when he is eating, he is not doing
anything else.
