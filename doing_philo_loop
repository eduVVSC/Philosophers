	Tomorrow I will do my philosophers loop, so I will initialize the thread and give to
	it the function that is going to make the loop, with a pointer to the philosopher;



	The philo loop is going to happen with every philosopher, in order to it to work i am
	going to need to pass inside it the variables that are needed to it's work:
		- All the time values;
		- The forks he has available;
		- Many_eaten;
		- Many_to_eat(if this value is -1, it means an inifinit loop of eating);
		- Is eating;
		- Is dead(this will be shared between all the philosophers, so it needs to be
		a pointer to the int value);
